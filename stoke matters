title stroke matters: torwards robust scene text feature extraction
Deep convolutional neural networks have achieved signifiant improvements in many computer vision tasks and most works tends to explain the nature of CNN by visualization the extracted features.
In this paper, we analyze the feature extraction process for scene text detection frameworks and point out the differences between general object and scene text.
The text region feature are firstly turned to be negative and flatterned by the relu activation funtion
point out the underlying inability of CNN in extracting robust scene text feature and propose the
